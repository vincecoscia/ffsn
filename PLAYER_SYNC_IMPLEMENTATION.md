# Player Sync Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation provides a robust player management system that:
1. Maintains a single master list of all ESPN players (avoiding duplicates)
2. Tracks league-specific player statuses (owned, free agent, etc.)
3. Efficiently syncs and updates player data
4. Provides fast queries for free agents and player searches

## Database Architecture

### 1. Master Players Table (`playersEnhanced`)
- Single source of truth for all ESPN players
- Indexed by `espnId` and `season` for fast lookups
- Stores global player data (stats, ownership %, rankings)
- Updated daily via full sync

### 2. League Player Status (`leaguePlayerStatus`)
- Tracks player status per league (owned/free agent/waivers)
- Links to teams within leagues
- Stores league-specific values (keeper costs, auction values)
- Updated frequently as rosters change

### 3. Sync Status Tracking (`playerSyncStatus`)
- Monitors sync health and timing
- Prevents unnecessary API calls
- Tracks errors for debugging

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Your Schema

The new tables have been added to your `convex/schema.ts`:
- `playersEnhanced`: Master player table
- `leaguePlayerStatus`: League-specific player statuses
- `playerSyncStatus`: Sync tracking

### Step 2: Deploy Database Changes

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

### Step 3: Add Player Sync Functions

The player sync is split across two files to avoid circular dependencies:
- `convex/playerSync.ts`: Contains the main sync actions
  - `syncAllPlayers`: Fetches all 2593+ players from ESPN
  - `syncLeaguePlayers`: Gets league-specific player statuses with pagination
  - `syncAllLeaguePlayers`: Handles automatic pagination
- `convex/playerSyncInternal.ts`: Contains queries and mutations
  - `getSyncStatus`: Check sync health
  - `getLeagueFreeAgents`: Query available players
  - `upsertPlayersBatch`: Update player data
  - `updateLeaguePlayerStatuses`: Update league-specific statuses

### Step 4: Integrate Player Management UI

Add the PlayerManagement component to your league settings page:

```tsx
// In your league settings or management page:
import { PlayerManagement } from '@/components/PlayerManagement';

export function LeagueSettingsPage({ leagueId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other settings */}
      
      <PlayerManagement leagueId={leagueId} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 5: Set Up Automated Syncs (Optional)

For production, consider adding scheduled syncs:

```typescript
// convex/scheduledJobs.ts
import { cronJobs } from "convex/server";
import { api } from "./_generated/api";

const playerSync = cronJobs.daily(
  "sync all players",
  { hourUTC: 10, minuteUTC: 0 }, // 10 AM UTC
  api.playerSync.syncAllPlayers,
  { season: 2025, forceUpdate: true }
);
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Initial Setup
When a commissioner first sets up their league:
```typescript
// 1. Sync all NFL players (one-time or daily)
await syncAllPlayers({ season: 2025 });

// 2. Sync league-specific data
await syncAllLeaguePlayers({ leagueId, season: 2025 });
```

### 2. Query Free Agents
```typescript
// Get top free agents by position
const rbFreeAgents = await getLeagueFreeAgents({
  leagueId,
  position: "RB",
  limit: 20
});
```

### 3. AI Content Generation
The AI can now access accurate player data:
```typescript
// In AI content generation
const freeAgents = await getLeagueFreeAgents({ leagueId });
const content = await generateWaiverWireReport({
  availablePlayers: freeAgents,
  // ... other data
});
```

## API Rate Limits & Best Practices

1. **Full Player Sync**: Run once daily maximum
2. **League Player Sync**: Can run more frequently (every few hours)
3. **Pagination**: League endpoint returns 50 players at a time
4. **Error Handling**: Built-in retry logic and error tracking

## Benefits

1. **No Duplicate Players**: Master table ensures single source of truth
2. **Fast Queries**: Indexed tables provide quick lookups
3. **League Isolation**: Each league's data is separate
4. **Scalable**: Handles multiple leagues efficiently
5. **AI-Ready**: Structured data prevents hallucination

## Next Steps

1. Add player search functionality
2. Implement trending players (based on ownership changes)
3. Add waiver wire recommendations
4. Create player comparison tools
5. Build trade analyzer using player values

## Troubleshooting

### "Too many players" error
- The pagination system handles this automatically
- If issues persist, increase the batch size in `syncAllPlayers`

### Missing league players
- Ensure ESPN cookies (espnS2, SWID) are set for private leagues
- Check that the league ID and season match

### Sync failures
- Check the `playerSyncStatus` table for error messages
- Verify ESPN API endpoints are accessible
- Ensure Convex functions have sufficient timeout
