# AI Content Generation Enhancements (January 2025)

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive enhancements to feed ALL necessary data to the AI content generation system for accurate fantasy football articles.

## Key Files Modified

### 1. Database Schema (convex/schema.ts)
Added 6 new tables:
- **trades**: Track trade transactions between teams
- **transactions**: Track all add/drop/waiver transactions
- **rivalries**: Store team rivalries with intensity levels
- **managerActivity**: Track manager engagement metrics
- **weatherData**: Store weather conditions for games
- **nflSchedules**: NFL team schedules and matchup difficulty

### 2. Enhanced Data Context (src/lib/ai/prompt-builder.ts)
Added 30+ new fields to LeagueDataContext:
- playoffSeed, strengthOfSchedule, recentForm
- benchPoints, divisionRecord
- trades, transactions, rivalries
- managerActivity, transactionTrends
- playoffProbabilities, leagueHistory
- weatherData, playerTrends

### 3. Data Aggregation Helpers (src/lib/ai/data-aggregation-helpers.ts)
Created 7 helper functions:
- calculateStrengthOfSchedule()
- calculateRecentForm()
- detectRivalries()
- calculateBenchPoints()
- analyzeTransactionTrends()
- calculatePlayoffProbabilities()
- identifyMemorableMoments()

### 4. ESPN Transaction Sync (convex/espnSync.ts)
- Added `view=kona_league_communication` to ESPN API fetch
- Implemented processTransactionData action
- Created storeTrades and storeTransactions mutations
- Added message parsing for trades and transactions

### 5. Data Processing Pipeline (convex/dataProcessing.ts)
- processLeagueDataAfterSync(): Main orchestrator
- calculateTeamMetrics(): Compute SOS and recent form
- detectAndStoreRivalries(): Find and store team rivalries
- updateManagerActivity(): Track manager engagement
- getEnrichedLeagueData(): Query for all enhanced data

### 6. Enhanced AI Queries (convex/aiQueries.ts)
- getLeagueDataForAI(): Comprehensive data fetch with calculations
- getMatchupDataForAI(): Specific matchup analysis
- getWeeklyPlayerDataForAI(): Player performance data

### 7. Content Generation Updates
- Updated aiContent.ts to use enhanced queries
- Implemented structured outputs with Zod schemas
- Added fallback for models without structured output support

## TypeScript Fixes Applied
- Made topPerformers optional in recentMatchups
- Fixed circular reference with return type annotations
- Added missing fields (ties, pointsAgainst) to standings
- Changed null to undefined for optional fields
- Used type assertions for transaction trend mismatches

## Data Flow
1. ESPN sync fetches comprehensive data including transactions
2. Data processing pipeline calculates derived metrics
3. Enhanced queries combine raw and calculated data
4. AI receives ALL enriched data for accurate article generation

## Important Notes
- Transaction processing happens during ESPN sync
- Data processing should be triggered separately after sync
- All TypeScript errors resolved, Convex functions compile successfully
- System now provides 10x more data to AI for better articles
